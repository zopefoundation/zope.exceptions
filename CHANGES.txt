4.0.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- Added Sphinx documentation.

- Added support for continuous integration using ``tox`` and ``jenkins``.

- Removed use of '2to3' and associated fixers when installing under Py3k.
  The code is now in a "compatible subset" which supports Python 2.6, 2.7,
  and 3.2, including PyPy 1.8 (the version compatible with the 2.7 language
  spec).

- 100% unit test coverage.

- Dropped explicit support for Python 2.4 / 2.5 / 3.1.

- Added 'setup.py dev' alias (runs ``setup.py develop`` plus installs
  ``nose`` and ``coverage``).

- Added 'setup.py docs' alias (installs ``Sphinx`` and dependencies).


3.7.1 (2012-03-28)
------------------

- Fix: missed to reverse extractStack entries


3.7.0 (2012-03-28)
------------------

- Added TextExceptionFormatter.extractStack and extract_stack


3.6.2 (2012-03-28)
------------------

- Fallback to traceback.format_tb when the formatter is called recursively.
  i.e. Don't let errors in the formatter pass silently.

- Fix deprecated unittest functions: assert_ and assertEquals.

3.6.1 (2010-07-06)
------------------

- Fixed tests to work under Python 2.7.

- PEP8 cleanup and removed obsolete build infrastructure files.


3.6.0 (2010-05-02)
------------------

- Added support to bootstrap on Jython.

- Added Python 3 support.

- The dependency on zope.testing seemed spurious, possibly a rest of a real
  dependency that is gone now. I removed it.


3.5.2 (2008-04-30)
------------------

- Updated CHANGES.txt.


3.5.1 (2008-04-28)
------------------

- Reverted changes in 3.5.0.


3.5.0

- Added the capability for exceptions to be formatted line-by-line.
  Unfortunately, also introduced a bug cause each line of the exception to be
  its own log message.

------------------

- Updated package meta-data.


3.4.0b2 (2007-08-14)

3.4.0b1 (2007-07-09)
--------------------

- Corresponds to the version of the ``zope.exceptions`` package shipped as
  part of the Zope 3.4.0b1 release.


3.2.0 (2006-01-05)
------------------

- Corresponds to the version of the ``zope.exceptions`` package shipped as part of
  the Zope 3.2.0 release.

- Deprecated the ``INotFoundError`` interface and the corresponding
  ``NotFoundError`` exception class, in favor of "standard" exceptions
  ``AttributeError``, ``KeyError``).  The deprecated items will be removed in
  Zope 3.3.


3.0.0 (2004-11-07)
------------------

- Corresponds to the version of the zope.exceptions package shipped as part of
